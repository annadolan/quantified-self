# Quantified Self

Quantified self is a calorie tracker app that allows the user to monitor calories consumed and burned throughout the day. In this application, we worked with Javascript and jQuery for the first time, and practiced persisting large amounts of data in browser storage. 

We built this project in module 4 of the backend engineering program at Turing School of Software and Design. Our learning goals were to to understand the basics of DOM traversal, event handling, and state management in Javascript and jQuery, to use Pivotal tracker to manage a project with multiple developers, and to use a production git workflow.
